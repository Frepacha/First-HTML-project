            <h1>Introduction</h1>

            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <p>African lions are the lion you see most often. All lions look very similar but they've evolved to adapt to their home lands. The Asian lion is a good example. They have gold fur and a gold mane unlike the African lion. This is because of the
                rich dirt in Asia.</p>
